The Testament
But till that day
What is God to me?
By the Dnieper-side
Roaring in my ears.
When I hear the call
Of the racing flood,
With blood for rain.
A fair land and wide.
Where God sits alone;
You will speak of me?
Loud with hated blood,
I will leave them all,
Right up to the Throne
Water your new liberty
In Ukraina, my own land,
Listen through the years
Clasp His feet and prayâ€¦
Bury me, be done with me,
Of all men that are free,
Rise and break your chain,
Then, in the mighty family
To the river voices roaring,
May be sometimes, very softly
Dig my grave and raise my barrow
Fields and hills; and force my way
I will lie and watch the cornfields,
