Gothic II is the second game in the Gothic franchise,
released on November 23,
2002 in Germany,
and October 29,
2003 in North America.
It's the sequel to Gothic.

The game events continue the ones from the first Gothic - as the barrier was destroyed,
many prisoners escaped;
many of them headed to Khorinis with fake titles (since the militia started to search for the escaped convicts),
and others remained in the mountains forming groups of bandits.
But things aren't quite that good in Khorinis,
as many thought - Xardas (the hero's mentor)
informs him that a greater evil is now threatening the land -
as The Sleeper was banished he made a last call to all his minions to gather in the Valley of Mines.
