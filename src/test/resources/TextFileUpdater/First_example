The first game of the franchise was released on March 15,
2001 in Germany,
and on November 23,
2001 in North America.

The game takes place in a medieval fantasy world,
in which humans are losing the war against the orcs.
The hero, a young nameless man, is forced to work in the Penal Colony,
because of his crimes. In order to continue the fight against the orcs,
the king needs to extract magical ore and use it for weapons and armor.
Every burglar, thief or criminal is sent in the Colony to work in the mines,
by the king's order.
To keep the prisoners inside, the king ordered 12 magicians to create a magical barrier over the colony.
However, due to complications, the barrier trapped a much larger territory than originally intended,
along with the 12 magicians and the king's forces.
Thus the militia blocked inside soon lost control over the prisoners,
and the king had no choice but to trade with the convicts.
Soon after the convicts divided into several camps,
one of which the Man can join in order to survive and advance the plot.
